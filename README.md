## FAQ
- Q: Will I be able to get my shirt? A: Probably not as this isn' t a real OSS contribution, I hope DigitalOcean is able to  identify this kind of _contributions_
- Q: Then why you created this? A: It hopefully stops someone to send a garbage PR to a real project and send it here.
- Q: Wait, if you say this why people will try to contribute to this project? A: I count on people not reading (the laziest ones). 
- Q: Are you against Hacktoberfest? A: Nope, I'm against these people making OSS maintainers waste their time.
- Q: Should I report this repo to DigitalOcean? A: Yes, please.
